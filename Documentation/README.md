# How to run locally
 2 ways:
  <!-- 1. Download the exectable file for your os -->
  1. Download the source code and run `python Main.py`

<!-- # Create a local build
 Download the files and build. -->

# NOTE
 Please note not all IDLE will give you the full experience due to not being able to run the command. For the best experience, run this program in a terminal window (instead of an IDLE)

# Helping
 Anyone can help, just make a new branch and submit a pull request. Not all requests will be accepted though.
 Depending on the request and what it does, depends on if it will get accepted.
