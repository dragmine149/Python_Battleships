# Battleships
 Normal battleships made in a python terminal

 Project made for fun, and also to learn things about neural networks (and ai) (still wip)

# Features
 Normal battleships working in python PLUS:
 - Automatic saving of game.
 - Network support, Play a game on the same network as someone else.

# Important Notes
There is a bug, due to how google drive works, where if you are using the api you might (rarley) crash. This is because your opponent has deleted a file to reupload it as you are trying to read it. If this happenes, just restart the program and everything will be fine.
I will try and find a way to edit files instead of having to delete and reupload.

# Helping
 Anyone can help, just make a new branch and submit a pull request. Not all requests will be accepted though.
 Depending on the request and what it does, depends on if it will get accepted.

# Future Updates and maintainability
I plan to keep maintain this program and updating it in the future. However due to the complex of this program not all things will be implemented, Below are some of the things that i personally will not work on.
- Using other file servers than google drive, Possible but going to be hard and annoying to setup. I also don't use other services mainly.
