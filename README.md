# Battleships
 Normal battleships made in a python terminal... or is it?

 Project made for fun, and also to learn things about neural networks (and ai)

# Features
 Erm, not much. Still in progress

# How to run locally
 2 ways:
  1. Download the exectable file for your os
  2. Download the source code and run `python Main.py`

# Create a local build
 Download the files and build.

# Helping
 Anyone can help, just make a new branch and submit a pull request. Not all requests will be accepted though
