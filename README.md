# Future Updates and maintainability
I plan to keep maintain this program and updating it in the future. However due to the complex of this program not all things will be implemented, Below are some of the things that i personally will not work on.
- Using other file servers than google drive, Possible but going to be hard and annoying to setup. I also don't use other services mainly.
